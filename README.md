# Pycutter
Using Python: audio2numpy, NumPy, and MoviePy for Removing or Preserving Silent Parts in .mp4 or .mp3 Files
- The idea behind this project is to find the threshold for the cut point in order to remove parts of the audio that are quieter. 
- By determining the shortest duration for cutting the silent parts, such as removing parts longer than 0.5 seconds of silence, we can extract the speech segments. 
- This Python script can be used to process both MP4 and MP3 files. 
- You can either clone the repository or use it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NickygenN1/pycutter/blob/main/cutter_colab.ipynb)
- For a demonstration of the functionality, please watch the demo video on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/6LRnvP1Ab90)
